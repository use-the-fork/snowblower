## Motivation

Have you ever wished you could pull down a repo, enter the shell, and have everything set up for you? ME TOO!

That's the purpose of Snow Blower. Setting up a project shouldn't be hard. Getting your team working in the same environment across the board shouldn't be hard either. Snow Blower makes it easy. Just add it to your `flake.nix`, pick the options you want to use, and enter the shell. All the other work is done for you!
